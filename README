Highlighted features:
    * case "cesm-cn_map-flexible"   : draw contours over map and diff for multiple variables, multiple time steps of multiple CESM ouputs. Files and variables can be added in the NCL file.
    
    * case "cesm-print-vars"        : print on screen of the average, standard deviation etc. for variables in multiple CESM files. that are in CESM files These variables can be already in CEMS outputs or be diagnosed by other varialbes. These diagnosed variables can be wrote to another file.

-------------
1. ncl_crt.sh (the latest version is 10.7) 
    A bash script that creates various templates of NCL.
    
    Follow three steps to use this script:
    (1) edit this script and set the correct file pathes
    (2) type "./ncl_crt.sh" to create all description statements
    (3) type "./ncl_crt.sh -h" to see all functions in this script
    
    Examples:
        (1) create a NCL script that reads varaibles var1 and var2 from file1 and file2 and make a contour plot. 
            > ./ncl_crt.sh -f file1 file2 -v var1 vars -s s1 s2 -t cn test1.ncl
            
        (2) create a NCL script that use a predefined case, cesm-prec_global-2files
            > ./ncl_crt.sh -c cesm-prec_global-2files -f file1 file2 tese1.ncl
            
        (3) look up NCL functions and resources
            > ./ncl_crt.sh -res
            > ./ncl_crt.sh -func
            > ./ncl_crt.sh -plotvars
        
        (4) Change a NCL script to the format of a bash script 
            > ./ncl_crt.sh -a test1.ncl casename bash1.sh
